## Objective
This research project's goal is to evaluate ChatGPT's code-writing skills by evaluating how precisely and quickly it produces accurate code. I'll be keeping a record of the process, counting the number of tries required to get the intended result, and examining any trends or difficulties that arise.

## Background
It's important to understand the current strengths and limitations of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, since they are becoming more and more popular for automating and helping with programming tasks. The goal of this research is to offer a methodical assessment of ChatGPT's ability to produce useful code, offering information on its accuracy, dependability, and potential as a programming tool.

## Methodology
- **Testing Process**: I will input specific coding tasks into ChatGPT, observing the response times, accuracy, and the number of attempts needed to generate the correct code.
- **Documentation**: Each attempt will be documented, noting any issues, corrections made, and improvements over successive attempts.
- **Analysis**: I will analyze the data collected to identify strengths and weaknesses in ChatGPT’s code-writing abilities.

## Expected Outcomes
This project will result in a detailed research paper highlighting ChatGPT’s effectiveness as a coding assistant, providing data on the accuracy and efficiency of its code-writing abilities. The insights gained may inform future improvements in AI-assisted coding.
